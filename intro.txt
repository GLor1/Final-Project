Hello World, this is my first attempt in uploading an essay to gitHub.
The purpose is to demonstrate how we can utilize github as a respository to safely store our work, minimize devices like usb, and external hard drives.

My first push to the respository was a success.  I definitely learned alot.  The commit after this one will include pulling the file.


I wonder what happens when I edit the code in NANO?
